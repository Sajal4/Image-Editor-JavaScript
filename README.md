<h3>In this project (Image Editor in JavaScript), as you’ve seen in the preview image, users can apply different filters to their image like grayscale, inversion, saturation, and adjust the image brightness. Additionally, users can also rotate or flip the images and save their edited images.
<br><br>This project is made with vanilla JavaScript. I built it with HTML CSS & Vanilla JavaScript. If you’re too beginner in JavaScript and didn’t build projects before, then this image editor code could be difficult to understand.
<br><br>
So, I want to suggest you build some JavaScript projects before continuing to create this image editor. But, if you’re familiar with JavaScript, the codes and logic of this project shouldn’t be difficult to understand for you.
<br><br>
Canvas part of the codes could be difficult to understand for you and canvas is used only to save the edited image. So, please go through the code carefully once, I try my best to make easier to understand the code.</h3>
